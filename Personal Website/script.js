            <p>Hello, my name is GUO Shanshan. I am currently in my final semester of the Master of Marketing Communications program at the University of Melbourne. This semester, I am on exchange at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I am taking courses in Organizational Communication, Health Communication, Public Relations, and Interactive Media. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Public Relations from Donghua University and have gained valuable experience in public relations and resource management through various internships and projects. For instance, during my internship at MCM, I enhanced the brand's market recognition by collaborating with influencers and managing product samples efficiently. Leading a team in a national innovation competition further developed my leadership and problem-solving skills, resulting in a second-place finish.</p>

My part-time roles in customer service and retail have allowed me to refine my product knowledge, inventory management skills, and teamwork abilities. Colleagues often commend my ability to foster a collaborative environment, and customers appreciate my approachable demeanor and clear communication style.
