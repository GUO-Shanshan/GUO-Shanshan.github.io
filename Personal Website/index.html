                    Hello there, my name is Guo, Shanshan. I am currently in my final semester of <strong>the Master of Marketing Communications</strong> program at the University of Melbourne. This semester, I am on exchange at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I am taking courses in Organizational Communications, Health Communications, Public Relations, and Interactive Media. I hold a <strong>Bachelor's degree in Public Relations</strong> from Donghua University and have gained valuable experience in public relations and resource management through various internships and projects.

                <div class="item">    
                    For instance, during my internship at MCM, I enhanced the brand's market recognition by collaborating with influencers and managing product samples efficiently. Leading a team in a national innovation competition further developed my leadership and problem-solving skills, resulting in a second-place finish.

                <div class="item">
                    <strong>If you have any job opportunities available</strong>: I am a conscientious and responsible individual with a strong passion for the retail industry. My part-time roles in customer service and retail have allowed me to refine my product knowledge, inventory management skills, and teamwork abilities. Colleagues often commend my ability to foster a collaborative environment, and customers appreciate my approachable demeanor and clear communication style. I believe in the power of teamwork to overcome challenges and enhance the shopping experience. My dedication to connecting with both team members and customers, combined with proactive problem-solving skills, makes me a valuable addition to any team.
